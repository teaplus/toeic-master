Unfortunately, our client in New\n                          Jersey called and said they have to reschedule the\n                          meeting date to the 5<sup>th</sup> of July. I went\n                          ahead and booked a ticket for the 4<sup>th</sup>. Is\n                          it ok if you go straight to Washington after New\n                          Jersey?\n                        </p>\n<p>\n                          M: What about the client in Washington?

I think this gives us time to prepare some\n                          additional materials for your presentation.

The company will be purchasing forty-seven TM-161 cell phones from Globalphone Inc. at the end of July. You will receive your new phone during the first week of August. Each employee will be given 200 minutes free each month. If you use more than your monthly limit, you will be charged an additional $25 each month. We understand that this is a new policy that may potentially be problematic, so we welcome any comments or suggestions you may have. To monitor the new phone system’s effectiveness, we will be asking employees to fill out a survey. The date for this survey has not been chosen yet. However, it will most likely take place during the third week of August. Also, employees with other suggestions about how to help employees communicate better should fill out an Employee Comments Form, which can be obtained from Betty Gill in the Human Resources Department.</div>\n</div>	part_7_81_83

It has so many useful functions! If\n                          anything, it has too many. (It took me a whole\n                          afternoon to figure out how to use it properly; but,\n                          then again, I’m not exactly skilled with electronic\n                          gadgets). It really lives up to the promises in your\n                          literature. The sound is excellent. My son-in-law, who\n                          is a concert pianist, was impressed, so that says a\n                          lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n                          Anyway, the main reason I’m writing is that my little\n                          granddaughter spilled her grape juice all over the top\n                          of the keyboard. I mopped most of it up at the time,\n                          but some got under the lid and now it’s a sticky mess\n                          in there. I tried using a damp cloth as the user\n                          manual recommends, but it’s just not coming off. I\n                          looked through all of the material on the website,\n                          too, but I think this problem is rather unique. I’m\n                          worried about ruining the finish, so I’m asking if\n                          there are any soaps or detergents that I could safely\n                          use.<br/>\n<br/>\n                          Thanks a lot,<br/>\n                          Randy Wilson\n                        </div>\n</div>	part_7_88_92

If you think you may\n                          have an affected Caldera Junior, stop using it\n                          immediately! The hitch connecting it to the bicycle\n                          can fail, causing the Caldera Junior to become\n                          unstable, which may result in injury. The Caldera\n                          Junior “tandem bicycle accessory” consists of a frame,\n                          wheels, seat, pedals, and handlebars. It attaches to\n                          the back of a standard bicycle by a hitch. Bicycle\n                          stores and retailers nationwide sold the Caldera\n                          Junior from March 2000 through July 2001. Caldera\n                          Juniors were also sold under the name “Caldera\n                          Mongoose”, with a “Mongoose” logo appearing on the\n                          frame. The recalled Caldera Junior has the model\n                          number AC 100, AC 200, or AC 300, on the top tube.\n                          Also, recalled Caldera Juniors have an aluminum sleeve\n                          on the hitch between the bicycle and the Caldera\n                          Junior. Caldera Juniors with nylon or plastic sleeves\n                          on the hitch are not included in this recall.

There was\n                          some mix-up with his flight, I guess. Apparently, he\n                          told his secretary that he was expecting to be leaving\n                          tonight, but for some strange reason she booked the\n                          flight for tomorrow morning. That means that he won’t\n                          be able to be here for his presentation. Anyway, he\n                          sounded really worried about it, and I didn’t really\n                          know what else to do, so I said we’d rearrange the\n                          schedule. He won’t be here until 11 o’clock at the\n                          earliest, so I’ll have to put you and Richard first in\n                          Session I. I know you were only scheduled to speak for\n                          about 30 minutes, but I’d really appreciate it if you\n                          could stretch your presentation out a bit – maybe have\n                          a question-and-answer session or something. You need\n                          to fill about an hour. I know it’s last minute, but\n                          these things happen. Whenever he gets in, we can start\n                          his session, and it won’t be too bad. I figure, at\n                          worst, we’ll be running about half an hour late.

It has so many useful functions! If\n                          anything, it has too many. (It took me a whole\n                          afternoon to figure out how to use it properly; but,\n                          then again, I’m not exactly skilled with electronic\n                          gadgets). It really lives up to the promises in your\n                          literature. The sound is excellent. My son-in-law, who\n                          is a concert pianist, was impressed, so that says a\n                          lot.<br/>\n<br/>\n                          Anyway, the main reason I’m writing is that my little\n                          granddaughter spilled her grape juice all over the top\n                          of the keyboard. I mopped most of it up at the time,\n                          but some got under the lid and now it’s a sticky mess\n                          in there. I tried using a damp cloth as the user\n                          manual recommends, but it’s just not coming off. I\n                          looked through all of the material on the website,\n                          too, but I think this problem is rather unique. I’m\n                          worried about ruining the finish, so I’m asking if\n                          there are any soaps or detergents that I could safely\n                          use.<br/>\n<br/>\n                          Thanks a lot,<br/>\n                          Randy Wilson\n                        </div>\n</div>	part_7_88_92
